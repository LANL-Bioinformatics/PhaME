What is PhaME?
=============

PhaME or Phylogenetic and Molecular Evolution (PhaME) analysis tool allows suite of analysis pertaining to phylogeny and moleuclar evolution.


Given a reference, PhaME extracts SNPs from complete genomes, draft genomes and/or reads, uses SNP multiple sequence alignment to construct a phylogenetic tree, and provides evolutionary analyses (genes under positive selection) using CDS SNPs.
